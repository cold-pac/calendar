DESCRIPTION:Dear Students/Supervisors\,\n\n\n\nWe have a supervisor/student
  Year 4 Medicine webinar on the 8th of May from 2-3pm to discuss the remai
 nder of the year 4 medicine program 2020. The link for the webinar is avai
 lable here<https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ODA5NjM1

 da1-4c01-b9a4-398d3929f62c%22%2c%22IsBroadcastMeeting%22%3atrue%7d>. If yo
 u are unable to attend the livestream\, the link will stay live so you can
  access a recording of the webinar. There will be time available for quest
 ions and we will be using www.sli.do<http://www.sli.do> to facilitate this
 . To participate online\, please go to the website and enter the event cod
 e: # year4\n\n\n\nCurrently all students will return from break on the 11 
 of May. I have invited the following senior Faculty members to answer ques
 tions and provide clear insight on our activities for the remainder of thi
 s year.\n\n\n\nThese include:\n\n  *   Dr Sean Kennedy (Program Authority 
 Medicine)\n  *   Prof Gary Velan (Senior Vice Dean Education)\n  *   Assoc
  Prof Adrienne Torda (Associate Dean\, Education & Innovation)\n  *   Prof
  Sean Emery (Senior Vice Dean Research)\n  *   Prof Margaret Morris (Head 
 of Pharmacology\, School of Medical Sciences)\n\n\n\nHere are our current 
 guidelines regarding Year 4 medicine (ILP and Honours) for 2020 that we wi
 ll discuss at our meeting:\n\n\n\n  1.  Year 4 medical students (ILP and H
 onours students) are not allowed to return to UNSW campuses\, including Cl
 inical Schools until further notice. Those students will only be allowed t
 o attend a UNSW campus under exceptional circumstances\, with permission o
 f the Head of School and the Senior Vice Dean (Research).\n     *   Due to
  these important restrictions\, all research relating to Year 4 medicine n
 eeds to be undertaken off campus/UNSW controlled facilities until further 
 notice. Clinical Schools are considered part of the UNSW campus and theref
 ore must also be avoided until further notice.\n     *   As restrictions c
 hange\, a plan is being developed to allow the Year 4 medicine cohort to r
 eturn to campus in a limited capacity. But this will need to be ratified b
 y the UNSW Provost.\n  2.  Year 4 medical students undertaking projects th
 at are not at UNSW Schools\, Centres or Institutes will need local approva
 l (supervisor) and further approval from the primary supervisor’s affili
 ated UNSW Head of School to attend those sites. However\, we strongly advi
 se students to continue off-site activities as much as possible.\n\n\n\nSu
 ggestions for non-campus/off-site activities that students can undertake t
 o complete their research year include:\n\n\n\nClinical Research:\n\n  *  
  Please discuss with your school manager/supervisor about applying for rem
 ote access to medical records or databases. Lots of researchers have done 
 this.\n  *   Move all surveys etc (with an approved ethics amendment) to p
 hone or video. Lots of researchers have done this.\n  *   Supervisor to pr
 ovide data for analysis. Another common solution.\n  *   Change the projec
 t to a review/systematic review. Some groups will be moving to a review an
 d if Year 4 students are allowed back in 2020 (with Provost approval) they
  will generate some primary data for inclusion in the review manuscript. I
  think this is a good option especially if students are now based overseas
 .\n\nPre-Clinical Research:\n\n  *   Supervisor might be able to undertake
  some preliminary work (if the restrictions on working on campus are relax
 ed and you have head of school approval) that will be sent to student for 
 analysis until students are allowed back in laboratories.\n  *   Superviso
 rs to provide data for analysis.\n  *   Change the project to a review/sys
 tematic review with the intention of publishing. Some groups will be movin
 g to a review and if Year 4 students are allowed back in 2020 (with Provos
 t approval) they will generate some primary data for inclusion in the revi
 ew manuscript. I think this is a good option especially if students are no
 w based overseas.\n\n\n\nIn accordance with Government and university guid
 elines\, as the COVID-19 pandemic evolves we will communicate with both st
 udents and supervisors if and when Year 4 medicine students are permitted 
 to return to campus.\n\n\n\nI would like to thank you all for supporting t
 he Year 4 students as best you can during this challenging period in our p
 rogram. And thank you to all the students who are working from home\, like
  most of us\, and continuing with research as best you can.\n\n\n\n\nGreg 
 Smith\nConvenor BSc (Medicine) Honours\nConvenor Independent Learning Proj
 ect (ILP Medicine)\nChair of Year 4 Medicine Committee\n\n
